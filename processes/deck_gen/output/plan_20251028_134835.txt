General guidance
- Voice and tone: Playful yet professional; treat dogs as “augmenters” that enhance culture, service, and brand.
- Imagery: Optional. If you later add images, use:
  - “White Background, Black Text, Just Title and Picture” (layout_index 48) for a captioned photo.
- Accessibility: Keep bullets/scoped lines short; avoid tiny copy. Ensure subtitles stay within character limits where specified.
- Next steps during delivery: After Slide 5, pause for discussion and approval of the 90‑day pilot.
