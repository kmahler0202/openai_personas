Great brief — fun and persuasive. Below is a slide-by-slide plan for a 7‑slide deck that’s playfully persuasive about MX hiring dogs as employees. For each slide I list the recommended layout (by name and template key), the exact placeholder fields from the template and my suggested copy (respecting the template guardrails), plus image/asset guidance and short presenter notes you can use when speaking.

Slide 1 — Cover / Opener
- Layout: Team Background, White Text, Title Slide (layout_key: title_only)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Hire Dogs at MX
    - (45-char guardrail: 16 chars — OK)
  - subtitle: A serious(ly) good idea
    - (40-char guardrail: 21 chars — OK)
  - todays_date (body): 2025-10-28
- Image guidance: the layout uses the team-branded background (no image placeholder). If you prefer an image cover, swap to title_picture layouts — but current choice fits an internal MX opener.
- Presenter note: Quick, charming opener — “Today I’ll make a case for a new kind of teammate: dogs. It’s silly, but also smart.”

Slide 2 — Agenda
- Layout: B&W Background, B&W Text, Numbered List (layout_key: b_w_background_b_w_text_numbered_list)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Agenda
    - (Guardrail: title must be <=6 characters — “Agenda” is 6)
  - body_bullets (numbered list): (max 6 items; max 25 chars per item)
    1. Why dogs?
    2. Roles & perks
    3. Legal & HR
    4. Costs
    5. Pilot plan
    6. Next steps
- Image guidance: none
- Presenter note: One-sentence setup for each item as you walk through the deck.

Slide 3 — Problem / Opportunity (single statement)
- Layout: White Background, Black Text, Statement Slide w/ Subtitle (layout_key: white_background_black_text_statement_slide_w_subtitle)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Untapped Talent Pool
    - (<=45 chars — 20 chars)
  - subtitle: Morale, stress relief, sharper focus
    - (<=40 chars — 35 chars)
- Image guidance: none
- Presenter note: Emphasize workplace challenges — stress, quiet morale erosion — and position dogs as an unexpected but evidence-backed lever for improving well-being and concentration.

Slide 4 — Meet the Candidates (fun “meet the dogs” roster)
- Layout: White Background, Black Text, Meet the Team (layout_key: white_background_black_text_meet_the_team)
- Placeholders & suggested content (use 4 dog profiles — must be an even number):
  - title_main: Meet the Candidates
  - team_picture_1 (image): photo of a golden retriever headshot
  - team_name_1 (body): Rex
  - team_title_1 (title): Chief Sniffing Officer — Talent Sourcing
  - team_picture_2: photo of a small waggy dog
  - team_name_2: Mochi
  - team_title_2: Chief Mood Officer
  - team_picture_3: photo of a alert shepherd-mix
  - team_name_3: Nala
  - team_title_3: Head of Security (Bark Alerts)
  - team_picture_4: photo of a curious terrier
  - team_name_4: Baxter
  - team_title_4: Prototype Tester & Lab Assistant
- Image guidance: headshot-style photos on neutral background (high-res .png/.jpg, at least 1200 px on long edge). Provide alt text like: “Rex — golden retriever, candidate photo.”
- Presenter note: Introduce each “candidate” quickly and with a single earned laugh. Use these fictional roles to show how dogs could slot into culture and operations.

Slide 5 — Benefits (three-pillar argument)
- Layout: White Background, Black Text, Three Column Comparison (Bulleted) (layout_key: comparison_4)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Benefits
  - content_left_bullets (left column — bullets):
    - Short active breaks → better focus
    - Lower stress, quicker recovery
    - Boosts employee wellbeing
  - content_middle_bullets (middle column — bullets):
    - Stronger team bonding
    - Everyday ice-breakers
    - Better retention & recruiting
  - content_right_bullets (right column — bullets):
    - Positive PR / feel-good stories
    - Community outreach & events
    - CSR / accessibility messaging
- Image guidance: optional small icons per column (paw, heart, megaphone) — use white template icons if available.
- Presenter note: Tie each bullet to a short supporting data point or anecdote (e.g., studies on pet therapy lowering cortisol, or recruiting stories).

Slide 6 — Roles vs Reality (practical concerns + mitigation)
- Layout: White Background, Black Text Two Column Comparison (Bulleted) (layout_key: comparison_2)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Roles vs Reality
  - content_left_bullets (left column — roles):
    - Office greeter / reception buddy
    - Therapy break companion
    - Prototype tester (toy / tactile)
    - Security alert (bark + watch)
  - content_right_bullets (right column — concerns & mitigations):
    - Allergies → dog-free zones & filters
    - HR policy → clear rules & insurance
    - Hygiene → grooming schedule & cleaning budget
    - Lease / legal → landlord approvals & waivers
- Image guidance: optional small icons (checkmark vs warning sign).
- Presenter note: Use this slide to show you’ve thought it through — every cute idea has realistic mitigations. Mention quick policy bullets like vaccination, behavior screening, and pet-owner liability insurance.

Slide 7 — Pilot plan + Budget (ask)
- Layout: White Background, Black Text, Title and Table (layout_key: white_background_black_text_title_and_table)
- Placeholders & suggested text:
  - title_main: Pilot Plan & Budget
  - subtitle: 8‑week pilot — 1 office, 4 canines
    - (subtitle placeholder present; keep succinct)
  - content_table (table content suggestion):
    - Columns: Phase | What | Cost
    - Row 1: Phase 1 | 8‑week pilot: 4 dogs, training, policy docs | $1,200 / month
    - Row 2: Phase 2 | Scale to 3 offices (optional) | $3,600 / month
    - Row 3: One‑time | Supplies, gates, signage, training session | $5,000 (one‑time)
    - Row 4 (Ask) | Approve 8‑week pilot & $6,200 funding | — (or repeat totals)
- Table guidance: keep columns narrow and readable. If the template auto-styles tables, use bold header row and align costs right.
- Presenter note: Close with the ask: “Approve the 8‑week pilot and allocate ~$6k (one-time + first month). We’ll deliver a measured evaluation (engagement, absenteeism, recruiting signal) and a go/no-go recommendation.”

Final slides / flow notes
- Total slides: 7 (Cover, Agenda, Opportunity, Meet the Dogs, Benefits, Roles vs Reality, Pilot & Ask).
- Tone guidance: Keep the voice light and witty on the cover/meet-the-dogs slides. On benefits, roles, and pilot slides shift to concise evidence + pragmatic mitigation. Humor opens the room; evidence closes the decision.
- Assets to prepare:
  - 4 dog headshots (neutral background, 1200px minimum), labeled team_picture_1..4
  - Small icons for benefits slide (optional)
  - Any quick data citations you want to drop into speaker notes (e.g., study links about pets lowering stress).
- Accessibility & guardrails:
  - All titles and subtitles in the plan comply with the template guardrails.
  - Keep numbered list items to ≤6 and ≤25 chars each (used exactly per template).
  - Meet the Team uses an even number of photos (4).
- Presenter timing: aim for 6–8 minutes total (≈1 minute/slide), with a bit more time for Q&A on the pilot ask.

If you want, I can:
- Produce the actual slide text placed precisely into each placeholder (copy you can paste),
- Suggest exact image filenames to drop into placeholders,
- Draft speaker notes per slide (30–60 seconds each) for you to use while presenting.

Which of those would you like next?
