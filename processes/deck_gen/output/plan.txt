Notes and tips
- Keep all titles within stated character limits; I’ve designed the titles to fit.
- For numbered list slides (layout 8), ensure each item ≤25 characters.
- For “Before/After” (layout 17), keep column titles ≤15 characters and balance text volume across columns.
- For table slides, use short, scannable entries; avoid overcrowding columns with long sentences.
- For slides with images, use high-contrast, agency-appropriate photography or annotated screenshots of your gems/tools.
- Optional additions: If you want metrics upfront, insert a “KPIs we’ll track” table before Slide 24 (use layout 29) with columns like Throughput, Cycle Time, Quality, Adoption, and Risk Incidents.

This structure tells a tight story: what we tried, what we learned, what to change, and how we’ll execute—culminating in a crisp ask.
