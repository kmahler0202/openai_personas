I need a deck to present to my 2 bosses on the AI team at my agency to basically sell the idea that we need to 
create a new framework for how we handl AI in our agency. I have laid out four different sections that I wll paste below with some major points to cover below them.

Section 1: The initial initiative 

The pillars and agile movement (there were 5 pillars)

Current status 

Section 2: Learnings over the last 5 months 

AI changing rapidly 

Meetings with peer group 

Sophistication of team 

Agent and Gem thinking and tools 

Competitive research – ai native vs. not in agency ecosystem 

Convos with senior stakeholders 

Your own schedule and “busy-ness” 

Section 3: How we might iterate the vision 

More explicit definition on what we need from ai to be competitive 

Blah, Blah 

Section 4:The path forward 

AI becomes a more formal ongoing process, maybe led by me 

Champion within each department 

Work with champions on the dev of tools and gems 

Auditing people’s AI knowledge – build on the initial survey and get way more detail 

Maybe make this in-person by department? 

Possibly lead off with examples of how AI is already being used to disrupt that dept. 

Method of AI “bookkeeping” 

Aware of what we use 

Monitor AI usage 

Custom tools 

Develop hit list of possibilities 

Develop plan for each priority 

Plan for evaluating what is built 

Plan for iterating 

More formal sharing of relevant AI news (weekly?) to keep people engaged
