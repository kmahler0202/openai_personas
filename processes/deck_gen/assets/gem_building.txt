A deck for a presentation to my coworkers (meeting style lunch and learn) all about Gemini Gems

What is a Gem?

A gem is an instance of Google Gemini that has specific instructions and/or knowledge that it always takes into account.
Tailored to a specific use case or domain.


So where do they fit for our agency? (Mx Group)
They can assist with productivty, creativity, workflows.
They can fully automate or at least assist in tedious, repetive tasks.
You all have ideas that me, Brendan, Eric, or Binz would never have.
This makes everyone an AI creator, enabling us all to discover new ideas.

When to build?
Repetitive Tasks (Competitive Research like we already built)
Agency Standards (Spec Librarian like we already built)
Potentially More here on when to build

When Not to build
One off explorations (Better equipped doing this with any old LLM)

Examples of Gems we have already built
Competitive Research
Spec Librarian
Ask Binz

How to build Demo
Pick a clear purpose / use case
Write instructions and/or role fo the Gem (Use an LLM to help craft this if you want)
Add Context / knowledge (Show how to do this inside of Gemini Gems)
Test, refine, share if necessary. Iterative Refinement > One time build
Show how to use variable placeholders if necessary (Mainly for something like competitive research)
